# Overview

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that you provision the same environment every time.

**Version control** is an important part of IaC, and your configuration files should be under source control just like any other software source code file. 

# Benefits of IaC

Provisioning infrastructure has historically been a time consuming and costly manual process. Now infrastructure management has moved away from physical hardware in data centers, though this still may be a component for your organization, to virtualization, containers, and cloud computing. 

With cloud computing, the number of infrastructure components has grown, more applications are being released to production on a daily basis, and infrastructure needs to be able to be spun up, scaled, and taken down frequently. Without an IaC practice in place, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage the scale of todayâ€™s infrastructure.

IaC can help your organization manage IT infrastructure needs while also improving consistency and reducing errors and manual configuration.

**Benefits:**
- Cost reduction
- Increase in speed of deployments
- Reduce errors 
- Improve infrastructure consistency
- Eliminate configuration drift

**IaC tool examples**

Server automation and configuration management tools can often be used to achieve IaC. There are also solutions specifically for IaC. 

**These are a few popular choices:**
- Terraform 
- AWS CloudFormation
- Chef
- Puppet
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Saltstack
